WELL WELL WELL, so I invited you to take a look at my Horse Manure robot. Congradulations, you should feel pretty good about yourself and absolutely should feel honored to be helping me out.

Anyways, this project is going to pick up horse manure for me in the pasture. I saw a random company that picked up dog poop and figured I could make that but for horses. I'll be adding 
a BOM and some basic information and will be building on this as I go along. I will soon be making a GitHub Repository for this project as well.

What I'm looking to make overall is a robot that is able to navigate our 2.5 acre pasture, and a secondary location for the sacrifice area as well for the winter months. It will have
to be able to maneuver a mostly empty field but with a few obstacules:

1. Here up in Washington state we get a lot of rain, so the electronics will need to be sealed.
2. Did I mention it rains a lot? Well that also means part of our pasture has water about 12-18" deep.
3. It rains here, so that makes the ground extra soft and quite muddy in areas.
4. Horses tend to kick so it may or may not need to be rigid enough to survive a kick. -This one is not as important but something to keep in mind. 
5. There will be some obstacules like trees here and there, and there is a wood fence but if the robot is low to the ground it my be able to fit under. 
6. The grass grows pretty tall, which for the camera may not be an issue, but to pick up the horse manure, we may need to get tricky
    6a. The dog poop robot has a trimmer and bucket, the bucket comes down and the trimmer trims the grass before the bucket fully picks up the dog poop. 
7. Horse poop a lot so battery life may be a big factor.
