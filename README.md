This project is going to pick up horse manure for me in the pasture. I saw a random company that picked up dog poop and figured I could make that but for horses. I'll be adding a BOM and 
some basic information and will be building on this as I go along. I will soon be making a GitHub Repository for this project as well.

What I'm looking to make overall is a robot that is able to navigate our 2.5 acre pasture and pick up horse manure.There is also a secondary location for the sacrifice area as well for the winter months. It will have to be able to maneuver a mostly empty field but with a few obstacules:

1. Here up in Washington state we get a lot of rain, so the electronics will need to be sealed.
2. Did I mention it rains a lot? Well that also means part of our pasture has water about 12-18" deep.
3. It rains here, so that makes the ground extra soft and quite muddy in areas. though the area to pick up will be the area I sanded over the years.
4. Horses tend to kick so it may or may not need to be rigid enough to survive a kick. -This one is not as important but something to keep in mind. 
5. There will be some obstacules like trees here and there, and there is a wood fence but if the robot is low to the ground it my be able to fit under. 
6. Horse poop a lot so battery life may be a big factor. 

First, I received a Jetson Orin Nano 8gb and setting up OpenCV with CUDA. I have to take around 500 to 1000 photos before training the model so over the course of the next couple weeks I'll be taking photos and labeling the photos with either Roboflow or Labelimg.
